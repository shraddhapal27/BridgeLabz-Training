## Week 1 Progress

### 🔹 Day 1
**Topics Studied:**
- POP (Procedure Oriented Programming)
- OOPS (Object Oriented Programming) concepts
  - Class & Object
  - Encapsulation
  - Abstraction
  - Inheritance
  - Polymorphism

**Practice Work:**
- Solved basic programs based on POP and OOPS concepts
- Implemented simple class and object examples

- Codes written and pushed to GitHub

---

### 🔹 Day 2
**Topics Studied:**
- Constructors
  - Default Constructor
  - Parameterized Constructor
- Access Modifiers
  - public
  - private
  - protected
  - default

**Practice Work:**
- Solved programs using constructors
- Implemented programs using **protected access modifier**
- Understood access control across classes and packages
- Codes written and pushed to GitHub

---


### 🔹 Day 3
**Topics Studied:**

- Static keyword
- Final keyword
- this keyword
- instanceof operator

**Practice Work:**
- Implemented programs using static variables, methods, and blocks
- Used final keyword with variables, methods, and classes
- Practiced usage of this keyword for:
- Referring to current class instance variables
- Constructor chaining
- Implemented programs using **instanceof** to check object type at runtime
- Codes written and pushed to GitHub

---

### 🔹 Day 4
**Topics Studied:**

- OOPS Modeling
- Real-world object modeling using classes and objects
- Identifying attributes and behaviors
- Relationship between objects (has-a, uses-a)

**Practice Work:**

- Designed class diagrams conceptually
- Solved real-world based OOPS modeling questions
- Implemented Java programs based on problem statements
- Improved understanding of converting requirements into code
- Codes written and pushed to GitHub

---

###🔹 Day 5
**Topics Studied:**

- Inheritance
- Single Inheritance
- Multilevel Inheritance
- Hierarchical Inheritance
- Method overriding
- super keyword

 **Practice Work:**
- Implemented programs demonstrating different types of inheritance
- Used method overriding to achieve runtime polymorphism
- Practiced usage of super keyword with variables, methods, and constructors
- Solved inheritance-based problem statements
- Codes written and pushed to GitHub
